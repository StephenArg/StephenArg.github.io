    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Stephen Argentina. I have bachelors degree in Food Science with a minor in Biochemistry. <br>
        I am interested in biology, chemistry, and using my new-found skills in full stack engineering to create useful
        applications, hopefully useful for the prior two interests.
